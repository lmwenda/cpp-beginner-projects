## Usage
I doubt you would want to try it out but if you do then read this part.
Each C++ Void Function has its own usage. Read the name of the function and choose which one you want to run. 
If you have chosen one go on the
```cpp
int main()
{

}
```
function and add the Function name with parenthensis

E.g

```cpp

int main()
{
  helloworld();
}

void hellworld()
{
  cout << "Hello World";
}
```
